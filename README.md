# JavaScript Calculator

## Project Description

This is a simple JavaScript Calculator. You can use it to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.

## Technology Stack

- Basic HTML5 for the app entry point.
- CSS
- React
- Vite
- Node Package Manager
- Node.js
- Math.js library for processing math operations.

I decided to write individual handlers for every button type, so the logic can be implemented individually.

I would like to rewrite the logic differently without so many if/else statements, and also include other operands and more advanced features like storing operation history using local storage.
